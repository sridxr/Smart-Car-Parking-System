# Smart-Car-Parking-System
This repository contains the source code for an end-to-end intelligent car parking management system. The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform real-time, vision-based detection of vacant and occupied parking slots from a camera feed, offering a cost-effective alternative to expensive physical sensors.
Markdown# Smart Car Parking System (CNN & Java)

This repository contains the source code for an end-to-end intelligent car parking management system. This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to perform real-time, vision-based detection of vacant and occupied parking slots from a camera feed, offering a cost-effective alternative to expensive physical sensors.

The entire application is built on a unified **Java** stack, integrating the AI model (using **Deeplearning4j**) directly with a full-stack web application (using **Spring Boot** and **MySQL**).
