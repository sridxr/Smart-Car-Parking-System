# Smart-Car-Parking-System
This repository contains the source code for an end-to-end intelligent car parking management system. The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform real-time, vision-based detection of vacant and occupied parking slots from a camera feed, offering a cost-effective alternative to expensive physical sensors.
